# AirBnB Clone - Web Static 

In this project, I took on the challenge of creating a static front-end for an AirBnB clone. The task involved using HTML and CSS to design and style web pages, with a focus on creating an appealing and structured user interface. Let's review the completed tasks:

## 0. Inline Styling 
I started by creating an HTML page with a header and a footer. The layout had no margin or padding. The header had a red background color (#FF0000), a height of 70px, and a width of 100%. The footer had a green background color (#00FF00), a height of 60px, and the text "Best School" centered both vertically and horizontally. The footer always stayed at the bottom of the page. I used header and footer tags and applied inline styling to all the tags.

## 1. Head Styling 
Similar to task 0, I created an HTML page with a header and a footer, but this time, I used the style tag in the head for styling. The layout matched the previous task.

## 2. CSS Files 
In this task, I created an HTML page with a header and a footer, just like in task 1. However, this time, I used external CSS files for styling. I had three CSS files: one for global styles (body), one for header styles, and one for footer styles. The layout matched the previous tasks.

## 3. Zoning Done! 
I added more styling, where the common section had no margin, no padding, a font color of #484848, and other specifications. The header had specific styles, and the footer contained the text "Best School," centered both vertically and horizontally. I used three CSS files for global, header, and footer styles.

## 4. Search! 
I created a web page with a header, footer, and a filters box with a search button. I styled the filters section as specified and ensured it was centered. I made use of header, footer, section, and button tags, with no inline styling allowed.

## 5. More Filters 
In this task, I expanded on the previous one by adding locations and amenities filters. I styled these filters as specified. I used header, footer, section, h3, h4, and ul/li tags, with no inline styling allowed.

## 6. It's (H)over 
I updated the locations and amenities filters to display a contextual dropdown when the mouse hovered over them. I styled this behavior as specified. I used header, footer, section, button, h3, h4, ul/li tags, with no inline styling.

## 7. Display Results 
I created a web page with a header, footer, filters box with dropdown, and results. I added a "Places" section with specified styles and multiple place listings. I used header, footer, section, article, h1, h2, h3, h4, and ul/li tags, with no inline styling allowed.

## 8. More Details 
I expanded the Places section by adding more information to each place article. This included price, information, user details, and a description. I styled these additional details as specified. I used header, footer, section, article, h1, h2, h3, h4, div, and p tags, with no inline styling.

## 9. Full Details (Completed - Advanced)
I took the previous task further by adding lists of amenities and reviews for each place article. I styled these new sections and their content as specified. I used header, footer, section, article, h1, h2, h3, h4, ul/li, and p tags, with no inline styling.

## 10. Flex (Completed - Advanced)
To improve the Places section, I used flexible boxes (Flexbox) for all place articles. This task required a good understanding of Flexbox for layout, and no inline styling was allowed.

## 11. Responsive Design (Completed - Advanced)
I enhanced the page's design by adding responsive features to ensure it displayed correctly on various screen sizes, including mobile and small screens. I made adjustments as needed to achieve responsive design.

## 12. Accessibility (Completed - Advanced)
I improved the page's accessibility by considering factors like color contrast, header tags, and other accessibility best practices. I ensured the web page was accessible to users with disabilities.

This project was a valuable opportunity to learn HTML and CSS for front-end web development. I followed the provided specifications and guidelines for each task and completed them independently, ensuring that there was no plagiarism and that the final result was a unique and functional front-end.
